## Data sent to the webhook endpoint (non-Slack)

Notifications are app events sent to a custom HTTP endpoint.  You can refer to
our ['Events' documentation](https://developers.scalingo.com/events.html) to
know the notification JSON format.

At the moment only `deployment` events are sent.

Example of a deployment notification:
