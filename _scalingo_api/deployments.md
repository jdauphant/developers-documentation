## Trigger manually a deployment from an archive

--- row ---

`POST https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/[:app]/deployments`

With this helper, you'll be able to trigger a deployment from your application
without doing it by a `git push`. You just need to provide a link to an archive containing the sources. The archive must follow some format:

* tar archive compressed with gzip
* the tar archive MUST contain a single folder at the root. This folder contains the sources of your application.

> The `git_ref` is optional. You can use this attribute to provide any string identifying your archive.

The [Sources](/sources) endpoints have been creating in order to let you upload the code
temporarily at some place and get a `source_url` for your code.

### Attributes

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "git_ref": "Reference in git to deploy",
    "source_url": "Archive with the source"
  }

you have seen in your terminal when running `git push`.

## Get real time output of a live deployment

--- row ---

> Real time output comes from a WebSocket

You have to get the URL from the `.links.deployments_stream` value of an app
object, it usually looks like to `wss://deployments.scalingo.com/apps/[:app]`
but may change in the future. That's why you have to first get an app and
read the URL from there.

First thing to do when connected is to authenticate sending an `auth` frame:

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "data": {
     "token": <api token>
  }
}
```

On authentication error, the websocket will be ended immediately.

Otherwise you'll start receiving existing logs and real time logs for the app
deployments. There can't be several deployments in parallel for a given application.

### Event types

You'll receive different types of message from the websocket:

* `ping` which is sent to keep the connection open and avoid timeout.
* `new` when a new deployment is triggered this event is sent to notify listeners
* `log` each time a log line is displayed, it is sent through this kind of event
* `status` the deployment goes through multiple states during its lifetime:

```
  queued -> building → pushing → starting → success
                     → pushing → starting → crashed-error
                     → pushing → starting → timeout-error
                     → pushing → aborted
                     → aborted
                     → build-error
```

### Details about the deployment statuses

* `queued`: whe received the deployment it's waiting for a slot on our schedulers
* `building`: when the buildpack is chosen and executed
* `pushing`: the generated Docker image is pushed to our registry
* `starting`: the order to start your app has been transmitted to our scheduler
* `success`: the application has correctly started, end of deployment
* `crashed-error`: the application failed to boot, have a look to the logs
* `timeout-error`: the application has not started in 60 seconds
* `build-error`: something went wrong during the buildpack execution, have a look at deployments logs
* `aborted`: if the connection is broken between the pusher and our infrastructure, the deployment is considered as canceled.

## Manually reset the deployment cache

--- row ---

`DELETE https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/[:app]/caches/deployment`

To speed up deployment, some files (like dependencies, intermediate builds, etc.) are stored in a cache that we call the deployment cache. This will accelerate deployments since if a dependency is in the deployment cache, we wont need to download it again.

However sometime this deployment cache get corrupted by a deployment or contains some outdated libs that prevent users to update their dependencies.

With this helper you'll be able to manually clean up the deployment cache.

||| col |||

Example request

```sh
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -X DELETE 'https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/my-app/caches/deployment'
```
