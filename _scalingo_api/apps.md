## Scale an application

--- row ---

`POST https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/[:app]/scale`

Send a scaling request, the status of the application will be changed to
'scaling' for the scaling duration. No other operation is doable until the app
status has switched to "running" again.

You can follow the operation progress by following the `Location` header,
pointing to an [`operation` resource](/operations.html).

The request returns the complete formation of containers event those which are
not currently scaled.

### Parameters

* `containers`: Array of the containers you want to scale.
  Each `containers`:
  * `container.name`: Name of the container you want to scale
  * `container.amount`: Final amount of container of this type
  * `container.size` (optional): Target size of container (not changed if empty).
    [Container sizes list](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/internals/container-sizes).

### Free usage limit

You can only have 1 small or medium 'web' container without having defined [a payment
method](https://my.scalingo.com/apps/billing).

### Limit

There is a hard limit of 10 containers of a given type per application, if you need more:
[contact us](mailto:support@scalingo.com)

||| col |||

Example request

```sh
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -X POST 'https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/example-app/scale' -d \

      {
        "name": "web",
        "amount": 2,
        "size": "L"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Returns 202 Accepted (Asynchronous task)

    }
  ]
}
```

--- row ---

## Restart an application

--- row ---

`POST https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/[:app]/restart`

In the same spirit than the 'scale' operation, the restart is an asynchronous
operation

Send a restart request, the status of the application will be changed to
'restarting' for the operation duration. No other operation is doable until the
app status has switched to "running" again.

You can follow the operation progress by following the `Location` header,
pointing to an [`operation` resource](/operations.html).

### Parameters

* `scope`: Array of containers you want to restart.
  * If empty or null: restart everything
  * Should fit the container types of the application: `["web", "worker"]` or `["web-1"]`

## Run a one-off container

Similar to `scalingo run`

--- row ---

`POST https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/[:app]/run`

To run a batch job, or an administrative task, you have to start a one-off
container. As its name mean it's a container you will start for a given task
and which will be destroyed after it. It can be any command which will be
executed in the environment your application.

### Parameters

* `command` (*string* **required**): Command line which has to be run (example: "bash")
* `env` (*object*): Environment variables to inject into the container (additionally to those of your apps)
* `size` (*string*, default `"M"`): Size of the container (e.g. S, M, etc)
* `detached` (*boolean*, default `false`): Foreground task by default, set to `true` if the container has to be run in background.


### Background vs Foreground one-off

By default one-off containers are started as **attached** command, it means it
will only get started when a terminal interactively connect to it through the
[one-off endpoint](/one-off.html). Once attached, data should be sent to the
one-off or from it, otherwise the connection will be automatically closed after
30 minutes and the container stopped. So for long interactive jobs, make sure
the process is writing something to *stdout* or *stderr*.

If the `detached` option is set to `true`, the container will be started as a
background one-off container. In this case the container is started instantly
logs from the job are aggregated to the total logs of the application. You have
to make sure this job ends at some point.

## Get recommended value for a metric

--- row ---

The recommended value endpoint let you get the value we recommend to use for the autoscaling.

`GET /stats/:metrics/recommended_value`

The metrics are aggregated by container types. If a type have more than one
container and the container index is not passed, it will return the mean value
of all the containers of the same type. The explanation about this value is in the
[documentation](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/app/autoscaler).

The `metrics` available are:

* `cpu`
* `memory`
* `swap`
* `5XX`: amount of request which returns a 5XX HTTP status code, indicating a server error
* `all`: requests per minute (RPM)
* `rpm_per_container`: RPM per container
* `p95_response_time`: 95th percentile of the requests response time

### Parameters

When querying a metric about resource consumption (CPU, memory and swap), one must also provide the
name of the container type of interest:

* `container_type`: e.g. `web`, `clock`

## Get metrics data of an application

--- row ---

The stats endpoint let you get metrics about the containers of an application.
These data include the CPU usage and the memory usage, split between RAM
and Swap memory. But also the number of request per minute handled by your app.

`GET /stats/:metrics(/:container)(/:index)`

The metrics are aggregated by container types. If a type have more than one
container and the container index is not passed, it will return the mean value
of all the containers of the same type.

The `metrics` available are:

* `cpu`
* `memory`
* `swap`
* `router`

If the metrics type is `router` the container and index params are ignored.
But you can pass a `status_code` get variable which will filter router metrics by
their status code.

Possible values are:

* 1XX
* 2XX
* 3XX
* 4XX
* 5XX
* all

### Parameters

* `since`: Viewing period in hour

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -X GET https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/example-app/stats/cpu/web/1?since=48
```

Returns 200 OK

## Get real time stats of an application

--- row ---

To get real time metrics, you can use the following endpoint:

`GET https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/[:app]/stats`

Return the list of all stats for each container of the application.

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -X GET https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/apps/example-app/stats
```

Returns 200 OK
