`POST https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/sources`

The generated URLs have a short lifetime and are designed to be used quickly (10 minutes). All the uploaded files are automatically
deleted from our storage backend after the links have expired.

The `upload_url` is designed to be used in a `PUT` HTTP Request:

```
curl -L -X PUT --upload-file ./archive.tar.gz 'https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/sources/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000?token=dc958153c3cd32659ffad5deeda9405d'
```

The `download_url` is designed to be used in a `GET` HTTP Request:

```
curl -L -X GET -o archive.tar.gz 'https://$SCALINGO_API_URL/v1/sources/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000?token=9df650a60014571abff0ee4e2d06a8fc'
```
