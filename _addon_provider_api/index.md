# Addon provider API

To plug your service to our platorm you need to define how we can communicate
with it. We are expecting a few endpoints to be present on your side, they are
detailed in this page.

In this page, examples are using the endpoint `addonhost.com/scalingo/resources`,
but this is completely confirgurable thanks to [the manifest](/addon-provider-api/manifest.html).

## Addon provisioning

Provisioning consists in allocating what your service is providing. For
instance, a Database as a Service would create and initialize the database and
return the correct credentials. The user should be able to use the addon almost
instantly.
